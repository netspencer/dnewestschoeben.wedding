        bio="Hiiii!! My name is Tay:) wow, I could not be more excited that this day has finally come. I met Dylan years ago thru mutual friends and realized we are the EXACT SAME WEIRD AND WEIRDLY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER HUMAN. We instantly became best friends and I honestly could not imagine my life without her. She makes me laugh harder than anyone else and is the definition of my ride or die whose always got my back and ALWAYS there for me.  I can honestly be in my purest form every time I am with her whether that is sad, happy, hyper, confused, irritated with life, she makes me feel normal haha! 
No but really in all seriousness I love Dylan and Spencer so much and could not imagine my life without these two dingles! Dingles btw is the highest form of love in my book. What a celebration of pure love and happiness we have blessing our way! Dylan and Spencer were absolutely meant for each other and are the true definition of YING AND YANG. I cant wait to be apart of this journey in seeing my extraordinary, beautiful Best Friend walk down the isle to meet her forever Prince Charming. Get ready ladies and gentlemen for the overflow of tissues. CHEERS TO LOVE AND MY BFF GETTING MARRIED TO HER SWEETIE ! 
XOXO"

        bio="My name is Olivia but I’m happy to go by Ollie, Olive, Oleeeve, or my new gangster rap name, “DaCheese”.
Although I haven’t known Dylan “Dildo” Newman for long, I feel as if I’ve known her for hundreds of lifetimes. (best friends in the Ming Dynasty— what up!) Her essence transcends time and space and her spirit is with me constantly — whether it be in person, in thought, or during our hourly FaceTimes.
Dylan has become my rock, my mentor, my spiritual advisor, and my best friend.
Quite frankly, Spen, I’m jealous."

        bio="My name is Olivia! I met Dylan at a birthday dinner about 5 years ago — we just happened to be placed next to each other at the table! I felt an instant connection with Dylan. We talked all night about everything from astrology to relationships to soulmates, and I felt like I had already known her for years. After meeting Dylan, I knew she was a special soul and that she would be part of my life for a long, long time. I'm so thankful to have a friend like Dylan in my life. She's caring, compassionate, and she cracks me TF up on the daily. She always comes through with the horoscopes when shit doesn't feel right in the universe, and I don't know what I'd do without her. Wishing you and Spencer a lifetime of love and happiness! Love you Dyl! ❤️"

        bio="Hi, I’m Casey! Dylan and I became friends on JV tennis in high school, where we gossiped and ate mooshy balls more than we actually played sports. We grew even closer navigating our quarter-life-crises together and medicating with live music. I live for her fascination with astrology (and occasionally laughing at it), which she pretends upsets her, but I know she loves it. And most importantly, I am her greatest subject because I am the least pisces pisces to walk this planet. While we haven’t always been joined at the hip, we always pick up wherever we left off when we’re together again, which is the best kind of friendship. <3 you Dyllie!"

        bio="Hi! I'm Amanda. Dylan and I met in high school because we were both on the tennis team. I’m so grateful that we’ve remained friends ever since. One thing that hasn’t changed about her is that she’s ALWAYS the life of the party. We’ve had so many memories (& most of them I can’t share because let’s just say... they’re not PG). She’s seen me at my happiest, darkest and weirdest times and guess what... she stuck around. If that’s not considered a good friend then I don’t know what is. I’m so excited to welcome Spencer into the family and can’t wait for them to pop out babies. I love you Dylan and Spencer !!"

        bio="Hello! My name is Izzy. I’m pretty sure I’m one of Dylan’s oldest friends. We met in 5th grade when she was exploring her interests in Jewish academia and transferred to Shalhevet. Dylan always has such vibrant and positive energy! My most fond memories are from high school. One time Dylan and I played secret agents at Starbucks during a friends blind date. We dressed up in Starbucks attire and successfully accomplished the mission. Although, we don’t see each other to frequently, I always look forward to seeing her and Spencer on double dates or Shabbat dinners. I am certain we will be in each others lives for ever. Congrats Dyl and Spencer!"

        bio="Dylan and I didn’t get the chance to create our amazing friendship until after college, which feels so rare these days. She moved into my apartment for a couple of weeks - thanks Amanda! - and we hit it off instantly, hanging out basically every night.
Not only did I love how kind, beautiful, smart and confident Dylan’s first impression was but also how mindful, receptive and refreshing she truly is deep down.
She views the world, including other people, in her own unique way. She opened my mind up in ways that you’d expect from stepping out of your comfort zone or falling in love. 
These are the qualities many people look for in life experiences, but few actually find - and I found them in Dylan.
So, I can’t imagine anyone luckier than Spencer right now. I wish Dylan and Spencer the absolute sweetest wedding and marriage and can’t wait to be standing next to her every step of the way."

        bio="Spencer and I met on Twitter over a decade ago and my life would not be the same without him. He got me into Silicon Valley, got me my first real job, and has brought multiple ideas that I’ve had in my head to life. We’ve never stopped collaborating on projects and I’m immensely grateful for his extraordinary talents. I couldn’t be more excited that he’s now joining forces with his perfect life partner, Dylan. I’ve loved Dylan just as much from my very first iteration with her and I’m thrilled to celebrate their future together. Dylan can read the universe and Spencer can put a dent in it."

        bio="Hey there, I’m Evan. I met Spencer during our time at Tufts. Like all great friendships, we had a ton of fun but also were there for each other when things got tough. Even though Spencer may wear glasses, his perspective and vision of the world is clearer than most. His perspective on all things is unique, refreshing, and energizing. He has introduced me to a whole new frontier of people and thoughts. I’ll forever be grateful for his humor, book recommendations, and love of rotten grapes. I am incredibly excited about the partnership that is Dylan and Spencer - Never before have I seen him so happy and at ease with another person. I cannot wait to see what these two will do together!"

        bio="Spencer and I started following each other on Twitter about 10 years ago. Back then, and still to this day, Spencer had an incredible free-thinking spirit that I found captivating. Much of our friendship has been spent discussing our approaches to our lives and work. About five years ago, while I was attending USC, Spencer moved to Los Angeles and we had the opportunity to briefly work together in the music industry. We spent many late nights on a couch in West Hollywood discussing how we could empower artists and free them from the record labels. Although we did not succeed in our mission and spent no more than two years on the project, it was during those late nights that I fully grasped just how entrepreneurial and creative Spencer is. Apart from his talents, he is a hilarious and loyal friend, and I am absolutely thrilled for him and Dylan, who is equally as wonderful and gifted as Spencer. Looking forward to meeting all of you and most importantly, having a great time as we celebrate the union of these two great people!"
