                      Rewind the clock to a long, long time ago. The year was
                      2016. Spencer and Dylan had yet to meet. Spencer had just
                      moved to Los Angeles from Boston. Dylan had been living
                      with her brother in Beverly Hills.

                    <p>
                      One night Dylan was invited to Manhattan Beach where the
                      two would meet for the first time. She showed up with a
                      cheap bottle of wine, a friend, and a green hat.

                      While Spencer was shy and reserved, Dylan was outgoing
                      enough for the both of them. She enjoyed the company of
                      his friends. That night marked the start of what would
                      become a year of frequent hangouts and a blossoming
                      friendship.

                      Fast forward to Spring 2017. Dylan found herself
                      mid-career change and in need of a study companion.
                      Spencer was a year in to the company he founded and was in
                      dire need of balance outside of work.

                    <p>
                      One evening, Spencer had been out with his friends at a
                      party on Fairfax Blvd. It got a little carried away, there
                      was a fight that broke out. Meanwhile, Spencer had been
                      strategically planning his escape to join Dylan at her
                      parent’s house. The strategy: hop in an Uber.

                    <p>
                      Fifteen minutes later, Spencer arrived and joined Dylan in
                      the kitchen where the two cooked some peppers and avocados
                      and made “tacos”.
